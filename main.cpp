/*									MainDesafioIC.cpp

This program was created in order to solve the proposed challenge by LEAD lab and contains the following functions in functions.h:
readSensorLog(), modulation(), movingAverage(), lowPassFilter() e main().

Using the functions above, the program processes sensor data, stored in the file sensor.log, and cretaes three new files:
- modulation.log: sensor data with a 2x modulation
- mean.log: sensor data following a moving average of 20 samples
- lowpass.log: sensor data processed by a low pass filter with tau = 0.1

The file sensor.log has data displayed in two columns: the first element of each row corresponds to the timestamp of the information
and the second element represents the actual data acquired in that time.
